The save .Rdata files have been ignored in the git repository because at least one of them is extremely large (about 2 GB).  Thus, rendering the document will not work out of the box because these files are loaded in the .qmd file.  Those lines can simply be commented out and the code which generated the data rerun (though note that the GP model run does take quite a long time).  Otherwise, the .html file shows all code, and the data files can be delivered another way if requested.
